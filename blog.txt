And the Journey begins...
It was all started when the list of the students selected for Citi Corp training program was displayed on the notice board .Some were happy and some felt sad about not being selected .We were so excited at the first day .It was our wonderful experience ,it was the first time we woke up so early got ready and reported to the college(it was thrilling as well).We all were really very amazed by seeing the Citi Building .Then it all started with some lectures on basic of Bank .And those short breaks there when we used to click selfies ,chat with our mentor and have our refreshments .There are countless memories we gathered ,among which the third day was awesome in which we played the pizza game as well as the games organised for citi employees on occasion of Christmas .At the fourth day ,We got a surprise when they announced that we have to do a project using what we have learned in those 4 days .We were little scared by hearing it.(As we are in the third year we don't know much about projects). Getting the project was also the fun part where we had to randomly select a cheat from the bowl and solve the puzzle .We were given the three equations with four variables which we have to solve (and obviously the fourth equation was 1+2+3+4=10).The group next to us was not able to solve and they said "it is not possible to solve that equation" , hahaha… All the class fell into laughter when hearing it .Finally the mystery of problem statement were declared and we got project no 2 where we have to built a trade recommendation system based on the market cap .We asked our mentors too many questions at that moment, we were really very nervous what is it basically? which things you should keep in mind while doing it? How to get started? how to implement it? and what not. We got a good guidance from our mentors.(I am referring the word mentors because we previously appointed a mentor but when she was not able to come on a fine day ,so another mentor for us was appointed ,So technically we have two mentors)
Sunday 18/12/16, the day when we started our project. Can we really do it? From where to start? So many questions were roaming in our mind .Thinking of what we did so far in our engineering? Do we really have some knowledge? But after spending couple of hours we had gotten an idea how we are going to start .Made the flow chart ,ER-Diagram ,downloaded the required softwares and just did the basic stuff that day. It was a stressful day .The next week we started searching the tutorials for different technologies or more precisely languages and collecting the info we will need afterwards .At some point we got so much info and got a lot confused on how to do it. We also made conference video calls to the mento.
We were experiencing the team work .how to adjust with the group ?how to distribute our work ?how we will get fast and easy solution while working in team ?We got to learn lot many new technologies like AngularJs , Maven, Mvc and test classes (Junits) and most importantly stock market basics. And our mentors were always there to solve our queries.So special thanks to them. We finally had completed with our project and only documentation and preparation for the presentation is left out part .I hope we all give our best on Monday 23/1/2017.
